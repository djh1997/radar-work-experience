### Addition

Likely the first way you'd have learnt addition would have been column addition for any non single digit numbers

For example if we wanted to add 105 and 27 we'd end up with a table that looked some thing like this.

|     | hundred's | ten's         | unit's |
| --- | --------- | ------------- | ------ |
|     | 1         | 0             | 5      |
| +   |           | 2<sub>1</sub> | 7      |
|     | 1         | 3             | 2      |

Whereas in binary we only have 2 options.

| 256's | 128's         | 64's          | 32's          | 16's          | 8's | 4's           | 2's           | 1's |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | --- |
|       | 0             | 1             | 1             | 0             | 1   | 0             | 0             | 1   |
|       | 0<sub>1</sub> | 0<sub>1</sub> | 0<sub>1</sub> | 1<sub>1</sub> | 1   | 0<sub>1</sub> | 1<sub>1</sub> | 1   |
|       | 1             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0   | 1             | 0             | 0   |

As you can see the ripple of carrying the 1 up moves a lot further in binary than it does in decimal.

Now try 97 + 155:

|      | 256's | 128's | 64's | 32's | 16's | 8's | 4's | 2's | 1's |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 97   |       |       |      |      |      |     |     |     |     |
| +155 |       |       |      |      |      |     |     |     |     |
| =    |       |       |      |      |      |     |     |     |     |
