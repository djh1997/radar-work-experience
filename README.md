## VHDL

brief history on [VHDL](VHDLintro.md)

Start with the [logic gates](logicgates.md).

Next learn how to [count](count.md) and [add](add.md) in binary.

Then move on to making the half and full adder to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
[Here](VHDLoutro.md) is an example structure if a VHDL project.
