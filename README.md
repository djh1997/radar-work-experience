## VHDL

Start with the logic gates [worksheet](/logic/logicgates.md).

Next learn how to [count](/binary/count.md) and [add](/binary/add.md) in binary.

Then move on to making the half and full adder to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
there is a brief tutorial on VHDL and its structure [here](/fibb/VHDL.md).
