## VHDL

Brief history on [VHDL](VHDLintro.md).

Start with the [logic gates](logicgates.md).

Next learn how to [count](count.md) and [add](add.md) in binary.

Then move on to making the half and full adder to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
[Here](VHDLoutro.md) is an example structure of a VHDL project.

A single page version of this site is available [Here](/worksheet.html).
