VHDL is a language that is used to describe the layout of the a PLD

There is a hierarchy of PLD's

- SPLD
- GAL
- CPLD
- FPGA

FPGA's are used for low production runs and high modifiability for future updates. Another use case is during the development of ASIC to reduce the prototyping cycle time.

VHDL and FPGA's their roots in a [US DOD project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_High_Speed_Integrated_Circuit_Program) from the early 1980s.
